Official repository for SemScore: Practical Explainable AI through Quantitative Methods to Measure Semantic Spuriosity, published and spotlighted for an oral presentation at the [3rd Workshop on Regulatable ML at NeurIPS2025](https://regulatableml.github.io/).

Abstract:

> Mispredictions caused by spuriosity and flawed model reasoning remain challenges in predictive machine learning and artificial intelligence; Explainable AI (XAI) aims to mitigate these issues by tackling model interpretability and explanability, guided by principles such as explanation accuracy and knowledge limits. However, these principles are largely qualitative, leaving researchers with few actionable tools to quantify issues like spuriosity, limiting their usefulness in AI development and research. This gap is problematic as it leaves researchers to perform laborious, manual techniques to assess individual model predictions—assessments that are subject to errors of human judgment. We introduce SemScore, an extensible toolkit that applies a novel method to determine the semantic relevance of models by quantifying visual explanation methods through semantic segmentation datasets. By comparing visual explanation methods against ground-truth semantics, SemScore evaluates models on spuriosity, enabling researchers to systematically measure and quantify the semantic understanding of models. This provides a useful and actionable toolkit for understanding model biases and behavior. We apply SemScore to various computer vision domains and demonstrate that SemScore can effectively evaluate and discern between models based on their semantic reasoning capabilities. As the first practical method for quantifying semantic understanding through spuriosity analysis, SemScore significantly advances the capabilities for XAI research. We release the SemScore toolkit and experimentation code publicly to provide researchers with the means to build more semantically relevant models and to extend our work into additional domains.
